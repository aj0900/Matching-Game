Hi, you are about to play a matching game. Pick two cards from
the set of 16. To start the game simply open 'index1.html' file
in safari or any web browser. The game is simple. If they are 
the same, it's a match and the cards will stay flipped. If the
cards are not the same, they will flip back over facing down.
Upon finding all the matching cards, you would have beat the
game. To restart the game, simply refresh the page and start
over. Enjoy!
