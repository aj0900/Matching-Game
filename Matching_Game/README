Hi, you are about to play a matching game. Pick two cards from
the set of 16. To start the game simply open 'index1.html' file
in safari or any web browser. The game is simple. If they are 
the same, it's a match and the cards will stay flipped. If the
cards are not the same, they will flip back over facing down.
Upon finding all the matching cards, you would have beat the
game. To restart the game, simply refresh the page and start
over. Enjoy!

Note: Only feature I was not able to implement was changing the
background color based on match or mismatch. 

Reason for this being I initally started with a different idea
in terms of how to go style the cards and what logic to use for
matching cards. The initial idea was to build each individually
using css and then comparing all the cards using a for loop and
if the matching card was also flipped then it was a match and
the cards would stay flipped. This idea was not the most efficient
idea since it would loop through every card and brought many 
unnecessary complexities. This inital idea took me a day and a
half to code and I was not getting anywhere so I changed my
approach and this time I created a grid and gave each card their
unique value. If the values of the two flipped card matched then
it was a match, if not they would flip back over and the user
would try to pick another two cards to match up. Due to intial
idea not working I wasted some time which ended up hurting my
progress and was not to add the background color changing feature.
My idea was to implement the background color change was when
the cards are being checked to see if they match or not, I wanted
to add an if and else statement to the that function. If they
match then change background color to green otherwise change it
to red and control how long the color stays using css transition
tool.
